# How to create a module for the APY! Launcher

## Introduction

This documentation will teach you how to make a module for the APY! launcher by looking at the API to control the launcher and the syntax for the module by following an exemple module.

The modules for the APY! Launcher are made using python.


## Basic knowledge to create a module

When the launcher reads a module, it will look for functions to get the name, description... of the module to display in the launcher.
These functions have to be defined for the module to work.  (See [API docs](Launcher%20API.md#mandatory-functions))

To control the launcher and add functionalities to it, you will use an API to facilitate the interaction with the launcher, so you don't have to know anything about the launcher source code to make a module !

A module can contain multiple files of any type to split your code in multiple files or add images to your module.  (See [module tutorial](How%20to%20create%20a%20module.md#adding-files-to-the-module))

If you have any questions about the API or if this tutorial is not clear or does not tell you how to do something you want to do, ask your questions on the discord server [here](https://discord.gg/pHPkkpXhUV).
