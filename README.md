# APY! Launcher
[![fr](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-fr-green)](README.fr.md)

This application is made to organise your installed games and apps and have them in only one place.

## Functionalities
As of right now, the launcher allows you to gather all your games and applications in one app.

When the games are in the launcher, you can search for a specific one by its name or filter all the games by favorites or type of application.

In the future, the goal is to be able to create folders, configurations to launch multiple applications at once and support controllers to recreate something like _Steam Big Picture_.

The launcher will also be the platform to download, update and play the available APY! games.

## How to install the launcher ?

> [!NOTE]
> The launcher is only available on windows
