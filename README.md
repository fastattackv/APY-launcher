# APY! Launcher
[![fr](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-fr-green)](README.fr.md)

This application is made to organise your installed games and apps and have them in only one place.

## Functionalities
As of right now, the launcher allows you to gather all your games and applications in one app. It also allows you to create folders and configurations (allowing to start multiple applications at once) to organize your games more easily.

When the games are in the launcher, you can search for a specific one by its name or filter all the games by favorites or type of application to find them more easily.

In the future, the goal is to be able to create modules to allow anyone to add functionalities to the launcher and support controllers to recreate something like _Steam Big Picture_.

The launcher will also be the platform to download, update and play the available APY! games (when some will be available ;) ).

## How to install the launcher ?

> [!NOTE]
> The launcher is only available on windows

1. Download the "APY! Launcher Installer.exe" file: [click here to download the file](https://github.com/fastattackv/APY-launcher/raw/main/APY!%20Launcher%20Installer.exe)
2. Launch the downloaded file, Windows will probably tell you "Windows protected your pc", because the application doesn't have an e-signature, to install, click on "more info" and then click on "run anyway"
3. Follow the instructions given by the application, (choose the installation path, choose which languages to install...)
4. The launcher is ready to be used !
5. If you encounter a bug or an unexpected behavior, please signal it in the "Issues" tab of the GitHub repository

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to or can't install the launcher with the installer or if you want to install a previous version, use the method situated [here](Documentation/Documentation.md#installation)
